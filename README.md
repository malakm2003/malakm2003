## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Malak Abdelhamid and I am currently studying computer engineering as a senior at San Diego State University.

Some of my interests include data science, machine learning, and AI. On the other hand, I am also interested in full stack engineering. My favorite language to program in is Python!
I am currently working on my senior design project with a group of other computer and electrical engineers. A fun fact about me is that I am Egyptian and I love to travel!
